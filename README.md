## Why this repo? And why Leanpub?

I had heard a lot about Wardley Maps and wanted to read his book on the subject, but I somewhat ironically don't find Medium to be a very good medium for this kind of material. I read a lot on my commute, which doesn't have the best mobile signal - so I figured the best option would be to convert the Medium posts in to an ebook format that can be downloaded and read offline. I also assumed others have similar challenges and would benefit from his work being available on ebook readers, etc. so decided to put some effort into this for the benefit of others.

I've also been exploring the idea of writing a Leanpub book for a while now, and this felt like a good way to experiment with it and get comfortable with the publishing process before diving in head first on my own material. Fortunately, Wardley Maps has been generously published under a license that permits sharing.
